 Scatterplot with horizontal line
??? Get familiar with the "faithful" dataset and attach it
??? Resemble the graph as you can see it
??? Add a horizontal line at y= 3.2
??? watch margins, boxtype, different coloration, labs

# bty - boxtype, "o" is default, "n" as suppressed box, "c", "u", "1", "7"
#??? pch - type of points (0-25) or letters on keyboard with "
# cex - magnification factor for all text, numbers, etc

```{r}
attach(faithful)
par(mar=c(4,4,3,3))
par(bg="lightgrey")
plot(waiting, eruptions, bty="n",  
 main="Old Faithful Geyser\n Eruption Data",
 xlab="Waiting time in mins",
 ylab="Eruption time in mins", pch=2, cex=0.65)
abline(h=3.2, lwd=2, lty=4, col="forestgreen")


```


??? Use the "cars" dataset to produce a plot of type step
??? Plot both variables on one plot (hint: par new!)
??? Use ann and axes to get the right amount of axes
??? Watch margins, boxtype, different coloration, labs
??? Hint lower level: axis and title should be used
??? Choose in plot text to identify the two plots



```{r}
par(mar=c(4,3,3,3))
plot(cars$speed, type="s", col="red", bty="n", xlab="Cars ID", ylab="")
text(8, 14, "Speed in mph", cex=0.85, col="red")
# this adds the explanatory text to plot 1
par(new=T) # allows 2 in one plot
plot(cars$dist, type="s", bty="n", ann=F, axes=F, col="darkblue")
axis(side=4) # y axis for plot 2
text(37, 18, "Stopping distance in ft", cex=0.85, col="darkblue") #
# explanations to plot 2
title(main="Speed and Stopping\n Distances of Cars")
```

 Create a histogram of 10k normally distributed numbers
??? Find out the hist counts for every bin (hint: plot=F)
??? Create a plot with the histogram and a line plot with the bin counts
??? Add text with µ, sd and n

```{r}
set.seed(56)
x=rnorm(10000,8,4)
hist(x, plot=F) # to check the hist stats
y=hist(x, plot=F) # store as y for easier processing
plot(y, col="grey45", ylab="", main="Perfect normal distribution",
 bty="n", xlab="")
par(new=T)
plot(y$counts, type="l", ann=F, axes=F, lwd=2, col="darkblue")
# y$counts is the data
text(8, 300, "µ = 8\nsd = 4\n \nn = 10k", col="darkred", font=2)
```


Histogram Multisheet
??? Get familiar with the dataset "quakes"
??? Change par to a 2 row sheet
??? Plot the two histograms on magnitude and depth on one sheet
??? Adjust the binsizes accordingly


```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
attach(quakes)
hist(mag, main="Richter Magnitude", ylab="", xlab="", breaks=11)
hist(depth, main="Depth in km", ylab="", xlab="", breaks=12)

```



 Boxplot of Diamonds dataset
??? Get familiar with the "diamonds" dataset of ggplot2 and attach it
??? Plot a horizontal, notched Boxplot of Prize grouped by clarity
??? Watch the sizing of every element for proper formatting!
??? Use margins if you need space modifications on your sheet

```{r}
par(mar=c(4,4,2,1))
par(mfrow=c(1,1), bty="n")
library(ggplot2)
attach(diamonds)
boxplot(price~clarity, horizontal=T, notch=T, cex.axis=0.8, cex.main=0.9,
 main="Price vs Clarity in round cut Diamonds",
 xlab="Price in USD", ylab="Clarity",
 cex=0.7, cex.lab=0.85)
```
