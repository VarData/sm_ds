### Probability Mass Function (PMF): 
A probability mass function evaluated at a value corresponds to the probability that a random variable takes that value.

### Probability Density Function (PDF): 
pdf (density function) is used to calculate the probability that a random variable V has a value within a certain range and in the limit 
of the range going to zero gives the probability that the random variable V has a certain value x. Mathematically, the area under the pdf 
curve over a range dx, gives the probability of the random variable V having a value within dx of x pdf is the derivative of the cumulative
distribution function, the cdf [1](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-physical-significance-of-the-probability-density-function)


### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):
In probability theory and statistics, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a real-valued random variable X, or just distribution
function of X, evaluated at x, is the probability that X will take a value less than or equal to x.
In the case of a continuous distribution, it gives the area under the probability density function from minus infinity to x. Cumulative 
distribution functions are also used to specify the distribution of multivariate random variables.

### Survival Function (SF):
The survival function is the probability that a patient, device, or other object of interest will survive beyond a specified time.
The survival function is also known as the survivor function or reliability function.
The term reliability function is common in engineering while the term survival function is used in a broader range of applications, 
including human mortality. Another name for the survival function is the complementary cumulative distribution function.

Let T be a continuous random variable with cumulative distribution function F(t) on the interval [0,âˆž). Its survival function or 
reliability function is:
